# Urban Vulnerability Index Web App

This Streamlit-based web application calculates and visualizes a Vulnerability Index for urban environments by integrating:

- **Built-up area change** from GHSL (1975–2020)
- **Land Surface Temperature (LST)** from MODIS
- **Built-Up Index (BUI)** from Landsat
- **Population Density** from WorldPop

## 🚀 Features
- Visualize input raster datasets
- Generate a composite vulnerability index
- Export results as CSV
- Interactive map-based visualization
- Ready for deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud
